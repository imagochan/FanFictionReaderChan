# FanFictionReaderChan
An android app that improves browsing Fan Fiction stories on a mobile device

Notes:
Forked from genious7
Updated dependencies and gradle
released with debug apk so that you don't need to compile the app.

apparently this app only works with fanfiction.net and now they have an app.
idk if ao3 was ever supported, welp this sucks since I was looking for a tachiyomi-like app but for fanfictions.
